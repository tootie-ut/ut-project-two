# Reflection on *out-side the grid*

This project was much more difficult for me. Whilst I understand the concept behind site generators. I struggled to navigate my way around inserting my content though the system. 
I do understand the logic behind site generators, keeping the head, footer and template of the website in separate folders. Does make sense. This allows the user not to have to go through multiple means of html pages.

I decided to create 2 html files with a css style sheet. From the project one, I became familiar with html and css. 

During our last session, with of course your(Ben) guidance, I was able to make my home page look the same as my html file. **however,** afterwards I mucked it all up and somehow disconnected the css link to the eleventy code. I was truly dishearten.

So, I hope you can accept my two html files with the css as my submission. The eleventy is still the file for you to peruse.
